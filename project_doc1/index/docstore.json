Tax has pervaded all walks of society \nas consumers, workers and stakeholders are keen to \nunderstand the tangible fiscal contribution made by the \nbusinesses they interact with in this ecosystem. This \ninput goes into the choices they make. The spirit of the tax \ncomponent pertaining to ESG is governed by a penchant \nfor a progressively fair share of taxes rather than merely \nbeing paying taxes that fall due under the current fiscal \nframework. The needle has evidently moved from minimal \ntax to fair tax.\nJSW Steel Group believes that as a corporate citizen it has \nresponsibilities towards the society. These responsibilities \ninclude constantly endeavoring to make the world a better \nplace to live. We aim to achieve these by focusing on our \nESG goals and objectives. JSW Steel Group is a pioneer \nin persistently taking steps towards these ESG goals and \nobjectives. We have embedded tax transparency as one of \nthe significant ESG goal and towards this, we are releasing \nour first Tax Transparency Report (Report) for FY 2021-22. \nTax transparency is increasingly seen as a method of \ndemonstrating contribution to society and sustainability. \nBy way of this Report, we aim to transparently share with our stakeholders, the key aspects of our tax affairs and \nour contribution by way of taxes to the exchequer. At \nJSW Steel Group, we are sticklers for transparency and \nas such a complete disclosure to all our stakeholders is \nof paramount importance. Our aim, through this Report, \nis to transparently disclose to our stakeholders our tax \nprinciples based on which tax laws are complied in various \njurisdictions where we operate. We have also captured \ntotal tax contributions made by the JSW Group in India as \nwell as the overseas jurisdictions. We have also captured \ntax governance framework which lays down the tax policy \nas well as other internal controls followed by the JSW Group \nwhile meeting the tax obligations.\nThis is the first Report released by the Company to reflect \nits commitment towards transparent disclosure of our tax \nframework. To the extent possible, this Report is prepared \nconsidering the guidance provided by Global Sustainability \nStandards Board through GRI 2071.\nWe invite the views, concerns and feedback from our \nstakeholders (i.e., consumers, vendors, employees and \nother workers, governments, local communities, non-\ngovernmental organisations, shareholders and other \ninvestors) on our tax strategy/tax practices. \n1This Standard is part of the set of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards).

With \nthis perspective, the collection and payment of fair and \njust taxes by the corporate citizens is a bare minimum \nrequirement and we at JSW are committed to ensure \ntransparent and progressive contribution to this socio-\neconomic objective. \nAs a responsible business house, with global footprint in \n100+ countries, employing more than 23,000 people, we \npursue a holistic tax policy that focuses on paying fair taxes in each of the jurisdictions we operate in. We strive \nto be transparent to our stakeholders on our approach \ntowards tax and compliance with regulatory requirements \nin the countries of our operation. We believe in sharing the \ntax strategy followed by the Company, in order to build and \nmaintain trust and credibility with our internal as well as \nexternal stakeholders. \nIn line with the above, we are glad to present our first Tax \nTransparency Report for the year ending March 2022. The \nReport has been prepared taking into consideration the \nguidance provided by Global Sustainability Standards \nBoard through GRI 207. The Report covers the tax practices \nfollowed by us and the way in which we deliver our \nresponsibilities towards the tax compliance and disclosure \nas required by the local laws of all the countries in which \nwe operate. We believe that this Report will serve as a \nmedium to understand the overall tax framework adopted \nby the group as well as tax contributions (as a part of the \neconomic contributions) made by us towards the society.\n5", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2053, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41652cb4-06a1-4213-bcfd-d116aaf0597b": {"__data__": {"id_": "41652cb4-06a1-4213-bcfd-d116aaf0597b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_8.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder\\page_8.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29183, "creation_date": "2024-04-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_8.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder\\page_8.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29183, "creation_date": "2024-04-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-22"}, "hash": "5272070e46945c19873199892ea055941cbef220a60a0843145358f1206f0e11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b418b8ea-e098-420f-b37d-43f3bc00ccb1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_7.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder\\page_7.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 24443, "creation_date": "2024-04-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-22"}, "hash": "c777aa85fd7990e73ae41f5308d956f5f5bb85404015ba12b747369d686c5d5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e52d8d5c-8a89-403b-ae0d-326d84a0d21f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f1922dd200a3b9cc4a4f413babf4f791cd6c567203b62025550281d0da2c8d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "JSW Tax Team\nWe have a robust team of tax professionals with rich \nexperience and qualifications in the specialised areas of \ntaxation.

We strictly comply with the applicable laws and \nregulations of each country in letter and spirit.\nWe have an in-house team of competent tax professionals \nwho monitor the tax positions adopted by the JSW Steel \nGroup entities. The Company has internal tax framework \nwhich mandates independent evaluation on tax matters \nfrom technical and legal perspective coupled with analysing \nrisk assessment. This tax framework is consistently \nfollowed on all tax matters including matters related to \ntransfer pricing, local income tax, cross-border taxation \nand indirect tax matters. While adopting tax position on any \nunique matter involving contentious issues, the Company \nseeks external guidance and the tax position adopted are \nbacked by the opinions of expert professionals and tax \nconsultants having subject matter expertise. In case of \nany divergent views on a particular transaction, we consult \nsenior legal counsels before taking a tax position. Open \ntax matters are reviewed periodically and presented on a \nquarterly basis to Audit Committee.\nWhile adopting a tax position, a detailed evaluation is done \non \u201cmore likely than not\u201d chances of success before the \nappellate forums. In case any new tax position is agreed \nupon or any existing position is revised, a detailed internal \nanalysis backed with technical propositions is done and \npresented to the Financial Controller and/ or CFO of the \nCompany. After their agreement, such tax position is \nimplemented by the Company. The key tax positions are \nalso discussed with the Board Committee on Finance. \nOur tax teams are carefully monitoring the developments \naround new taxes in key jurisdictions where we have \ncustomers and vendors. The tax team keeps providing \nperiodical updates to the Financial Controller and/ or CFO \nand takes guidance on complex issues.\nWe follow the OECD framework along with the domestic \nlaws relevant to transfer pricing of goods and services \namong our group entities. We do not use jurisdictions \nclassified as tax havens or low tax jurisdictions for \ndiverting profits. If as part of any acquisition there are \nentities in low tax jurisdictions, we are in the process \nof streamlining the overall historically acquired holding \nstructure from tax perspective. Through our group tax policy, we commit to abide by the \nfollowing aspects:\n\u2022  We endeavor to comply with the letter and spirit of the \ntax laws and regulations of the countries in which we \noperate in.\n\u2022  We have a strict resistance against shifting profits to \nlow tax jurisdictions.\n\u2022  We refrain from creating cross border tax structures \nwithout any commercial substance.\n\u2022  We undertake related party transactions, both \ndomestic and international, on arm\u2019s length basis.\n\u2022  We do not use jurisdictions classified as tax havens \nfor tax avoidance.\nAs a part of the Company\u2019s tax risk management procedure:\n\u2022  Our tax team remains abreast of developments in the \ntax regulations and jurisprudence relevant to the tax \nmatters of the Company. \n\u2022  In case any change in a material key predetermined tax \nposition is anticipated on account of developments in \nlaw or jurisprudence, the tax position is re-visited by \nthe tax team \n\u2022  Consultations are sought from external tax advisors \nif any change in tax position is envisaged\n\u2022  If necessary, the tax positions are revised after \ndeliberation with the Board Committee on Finance. \nFor instance, the Government of India had, vide Finance \nAct 2022, introduced new provisions for withholding of \ntax under section 194R of the Income-tax Act, 1961 with \neffect from  July 01, 2022.
